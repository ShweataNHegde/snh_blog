# TL;DR


# Getting Started Writing
1. Start writing somewhere.  I don't care if it's on pen and paper or in Wordpress.  Just start jotting down those notes.  Write down some context, and the meat of the content.  e.g. 
    > Today Joe Employee closed all the stories.  Here's the script i wrote to "unclose" them.<br/>
    ```js
    var gr ...//grumble grubmle
    ```
    <cite>Past self</cite>
1. Decide what you the purpose of your writing is.  Do you want to just share the things you've done?  Is this specific to one niche?  What is the goal?  What does "Success" look like to you?  Without thinking about this, you can write but you will be faced with many more decisions about what to post and why you should or shouldn't post it.  Decided this stuff ahead of time, makes it clear to you what you should share.
1. Start a backlog for content.  You will have fleeting thoughts about things and some of them are good, some not so much.  Make a note of ones that call to you.  Writing these down gives you a place to keep adding related ideas.  I use github issues, however you could use wordpress drafts, or again pen and paper.

So in short, just start taking notes, figure out what and why you'd want to share those notes, and start a backlog for fleeting thoughts.

# Picking a host
1. Decide if you want to just deal with the content or if you want to own the stack.  I always want to not pay so when I purge my spending I don't nix my sites.  I thought I'd look up to see a comparison of wix, squarespace, and wordpress but there isn't a good one.  Here's mine.
